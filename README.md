# Pre-AIAP

The pre-AIAP curriculum covers three fundamental topics: Unsupervised Learning, Regression, and Machine Learning Operations (MLOps). Knowledge of these topics is essential as an AI/ML practitioner and are prerequisite to topics covered in Deep-skilling.

AIAP adopts independent learning as the primary teaching methodology. Hence, similar to the Deep-skilling phase, each covered topic will have its corresponding assignment served through Jupyter Notebook. These assignments contain questions to guide your self-learning. You are free to use any legally obtainable learning resources to answer these questions and build up your knowledge pool.

## Topics

The pre-AIAP curriculum consists of the following topics:

1. [Unsupervised Learning](assignment1/README.md)
2. [Regression and Hyperparameter Tuning](assignment2/README.md)
3. [Prelude to MLOps and SWE](assignment3)

## Starting

Download this repository as a zip file to kickstart your learning journey. Alternatively, you can git clone this repository locally.

You can find the learning materials for each topic under their respective folder (example `assignment1`). Each folder will contain a `README.md` file that provides an overview and deliverables of the assignment (except `assignment3`). Each folder also contains Jupyter Notebook file(s). You are to record all your answers in the Jupyter Notebook files.

We recommend apprentices to document their answers understandably (for example, avoid just pasting the link of the learning resource. Try summarizing the essence of the article). It will allow the AI Engineers in AISG to review your work easier. More importantly, you can build your knowledge bank, which you can continuously reference in your AI/ML journey.  

For documentation purposes, you are required to upload your assignments to your batch's deep skilling GitLab repository, to which you will be granted access on the 1st day of the AIAP programme. More information will be provided on the start day of AIAP.

## Things to note

- Technical questions associated with the Pre-AIAP assignments will be discussed in the deep skilling phase.
  
- **Pre-AIAP materials (assignments, sharing, project, etc) MUST NOT be shared publicly (Github, Medium, etc).**
